## Description
This project is a simple d3 visualization that shows basic SVG graphics primitives and it displays rectangles, circles, lines, and polygons using d3.js.

## Interaction
- The rectangle changes color when clicked (from blue to purple).

## Technical Achievements
- Used d3 to create and manipulate SVG elements.
- Added basic event handling for user interaction (click interaction for rectangle and hover interaction for circle).
- Hosted the visualization using GitHub Pages.

## Design Achievements
- Used different colors to distinguish each shape.
- Arranged shapes so they are clearly visible and do not overlap.
