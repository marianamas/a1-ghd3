Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3

## Description
This project is a simple D3 visualization that shows basic SVG graphics primitives and interaction techniques using D3.js. The vis includes multiple SVG shapes rendered on a single canvas and showcases user interaction, smooth transitions, and a linked interaction between graphical elements.

## Interaction
- The rectangle changes color when clicked (from blue to purple).
- This interaction also triggers a linked interaction, where the circle’s color changes in response to the rectangle being clicked.

- The circle changes size and color when hovered over (from red to orange).

## Technical Achievements
- Used d3 to create and manipulate SVG elements.
- Implemented multiple interaction techniques, including click and hover events.
- Added smooth transitions using D3’s transition API.
- Implemented a linked interaction, where user interaction with one shape affects another shape.
- Hosted and deployed the visualization using GitHub Pages.

## Design Achievements
- Used different colors to distinguish each shape.
- Arranged shapes so they are clearly visible and do not overlap.
- Added text labeling to improve clarity and presentation.
- Enhanced user experience through animated transitions.
